This is a website set up by Lisa and Panja to demonstrate what we have learnt during the last 8 weeks on the Code First: Professionals course. We have incorporated the skills we have learned from html, css and bootstrap to try to make our webiste look aesthetically pleasing on a mobile, tablet or full screen.

Our inspiration came from nature and the role that maths plays in the colours and shapes around us.
